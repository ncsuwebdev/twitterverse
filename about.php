            <p>
                NC State on Twitter takes all of the official NC State University 
                Twitter accounts we know about and shows the most recent "tweets" 
                in one combined timeline. No more scouring the social media sphere 
                to find out who's in and who's not-it's all right here, pulled 
                straight from Twitter every time you load the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've also assembled a <a href="orgs.php">list of official Twitter accounts</a> if you want 
                to pick and choose who you follow. In case you have no idea what any 
                of this is about, there's also a <a href="what.php">quick overview of Twitter</a>, how to do 
                it and a handful of resources from social media pros to help you get 
                started.
            </p>

                If your NC State organization is on Twitter but not part of the NC 
                State on Twitter collection? Send us an email at <a href="mailto:twitter@ncsu.edu">twitter@ncsu.edu</a>. As 
                long as you're using Twitter on behalf of an NC State entity (and have 
                permission to do so) and clearly identify yourself and your affiliation, 
                we'll add you to the list. We haven't started listing individual Twitter 
                accounts of NC State people yet, just accounts that represent 
                organizations (think colleges, departments, divisions, units, clubs, etc.).
            </p>

                NC State on Twitter is a collaborative project shared jointly by

                (specifically Web Communications and Outreach Technology respectively).

                Since this site aggregates content created for and distributed through 
                Twitter, we can't always guarantee exactly what's going to show up in 
                the timeline. Posts are displayed on this site as a service to the university 
                community. The content of specific posts belongs solely to the individuals 
                responsible for creating and posting the content through Twitter and do not 
                necessarily represent NC State University.
